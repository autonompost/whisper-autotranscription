# whisperX Usage

There is also the possibility to use [whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) instead of `whisper`.

For this you need a [huggingface account](https://huggingface.co) and a token.

You will also need to accept the Terms and Conditions for [speaker-diarization](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization) and [segmentation](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation).
